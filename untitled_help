sudo cp /home/amal/Documents/home-sweet-arch/system_monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable system_monitor
sudo systemctl start system_monitor
sudo systemctl status system_monitor
The service is configured to run as your user (amal), restart automatically if it crashes, and start after the network is up. If you move the executable to a different location (e.g., bin), update the ExecStart path in the service file and reload systemd.
